# harbor-cve-finder

`harbor-cve-finder` (hcf) is a tool which polls information from a configurable Harbor instance in order to analyze CVE reports.

Run `hcf` like this.

the switch `-p`/`--package` may contain a substring expression of the package with a CVE finding. Currently only CVEs of the range `HIGH` and `CRITICAL` will be shown. Future versions will make this configurable.

```bash
go run -e find https://your/harbor/registry -p openssh

You can also download a compiled AMD64 Linux binary from the [Releases section](https://github.com/ppxl/harbor-cve-finder/releases) and run that instead of installing Go first ;)
